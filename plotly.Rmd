I will be using the "Instacart" dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("instacart")

instacart = instacart %>% 
  filter (
    order_dow == 5| order_dow == 6,
    reordered == 1,
    days_since_prior_order <= 14,
    add_to_cart_order < 5) %>% 
  select(-eval_set, -reordered)
# filtering the instacart dataset to include orders that were ordered over the weekend, reordered and within the last 2 weeks and are in the first 5 items that people add to their carts

```
