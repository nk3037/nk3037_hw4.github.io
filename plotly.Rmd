I will be using the "Instacart" dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("instacart")

instacart = instacart %>% 
  filter (
    order_dow == 5| order_dow == 6,
    reordered == 1,
    days_since_prior_order <= 14,
    add_to_cart_order < 5) %>% 
  select(-eval_set, -reordered)
# filtering the instacart dataset to include orders that were ordered over the weekend, reordered and within the last 2 weeks and are in the first 5 items that people add to their carts
```

# Plots
## Bar plot
```{r}
order_count = instacart %>%
  group_by(order_hour_of_day) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

x_labels = 0:24

order_count %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~order_hour_of_day, y = ~count, type = "bar") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(type = "category", tickmode = "array", tickvals = x_labels, ticktext = x_labels, title = "Orders by hour of the day"))
```

## Box plot
```{r}
instacart = instacart %>%
  mutate(day = ifelse(order_dow == 5, "Saturday","Sunday"))

instacart %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~day, y = ~days_since_prior_order, type = "box")

```

line graph - which aisle had the most orders

```{r}

```
